# Goals
- Boosting as a powerful ensemble machine learning technique
- Boosting for regression problems (GradientBoosting Regressor)
- Boosting for classification problems (GradientBoostingClassifier)
- Difference between AdaBoost and Gradient Boosting
- Understand hyperparameters associated to Boosting
  (learning rate, number of estimators ...)
- GridSearch for optimal hyperparameters for Boosting
- Performance of Boosting compared to other machine learning algorithms

### Morning:
