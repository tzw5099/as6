Welcome to the DSI's Python Introduction.  Here are some [lecture notes](https://github.com/gschool/DSI_Lectures/tree/master/python-intro/notes/notes.md) that contain information on python data structures, built-ins and other advanced topics as well as ipython.

Here is the [day one assignment.](pair.md)  Feel free to work in pairs.

If you haven't already installed programs in the precourse work, read these [installation notes](https://github.com/gschool/DSI_Lectures/tree/master/python-intro/notes/computer_setup.md).  This assignment requires a text editor and the Anaconda distribution of Python.
