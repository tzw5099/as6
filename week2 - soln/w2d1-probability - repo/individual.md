## Probability Exercises

1. Suppose two cards are drawn from a standard 52 card deck.
  * What's the probability that the first is a queen and the second is a king?
  * What's the probability that both cards are queens?
  * Suppose that before the second card was drawn, the first was inserted back into the deck and the deck reshuffled. What's the probability that both cards are queens?

2. A Store Manager wants to understand how his customers use different payment methods, and suspects that the size of the purchase is a major deciding factor. He organizes the table below.

   |           | Cash | Debit | Credit |
   |-----------|:----:|------:|--------|
   | Under $20 |  400 |   150 | 150    |
   | $20 - $50 |  200 |  1200 | 800    |
   | Over $50  |  100 |   600 | 1400   |

   * Given that a customer spent over $50, what's the probability that the customer used a credit card?
   * Given that a customer paid in cash, what's the probability that the customer spent less than $20?
   * What's the probability that a customer spent under $20 using cash?


3. A Galvanize grad is looking for her first job!  Given that she is freaked out, her chances of not getting an offer are 70%.  Given that she isn't freaked out, her chances of not getting an offer are 30%.  Suppose that the probability that she's freaked out is 80%. What's the probability that she gets an offer?

4. Google decides to do random drug tests for heroin on their employees.
   They know that 3% of their population uses heroin. The drug test has the
   following accuracy: The test correctly identifies 95% of the
   heroin users (sensitivity) and 90% of the non-users (specificity).

   |                | Uses heroin | Doesn't use heroin |
   | -------------- | ----------: | -----------------: |
   | Tests positive |        0.95 |               0.10 |
   | Tests negative |        0.05 |               0.90 |

   Alice gets tested and the test comes back positive. What is the probability
   that she uses heroin?

5. The Birthday Problem.  Suppose there are 23 people in a data science class, lined up in a single file line.  
Let A_i be the event that the i'th person doesn't have the same birthday as the j'th person for any j < i.  
Use the chain rule from probability to calculate the probability that at least 2 people share the same birthday.
