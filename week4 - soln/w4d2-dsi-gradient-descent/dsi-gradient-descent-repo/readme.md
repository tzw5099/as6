## Gradient Descent

Today we will be covering Gradient Descent and its variations. This will be an all day pair exercise.

We'll be implementing logistic regression ourselves using the Gradient Descent algorithm.

### Objectives

1. Know when and why to use Gradient Descent.
2. Implement the Gradient Descent algorithm and understand different convergence criteria.
3. Know what Stochastic Gradient Descent is and understand its pros and cons.
4. Know what Newton's method is and understand its pros and cons.

Here is the [pair exercise](pair.md).
